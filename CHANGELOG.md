# Changelog for the module

The format is based on and uses the types of changes according to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New command `Get-AzTokenCache`, closes #96 
- New parameters for `Clear-AzTokenCache`
  - The new `-Force` parameter will attempt to delete the entire token cache directory instead of only clearing it from tokens. *Use at your own risk*, since it deletes a directory and recursively deletes its files on disk.
  - The new `-RootPath` allows for specifying a custom root directory for token caches. This may show up in other commands in the future.
- All token cache parameters now support argument completers to suggest existing caches in the chosen root directory
- Alias `-Name` added for `TokenCache` parameter for Clear- & Get-commands.
